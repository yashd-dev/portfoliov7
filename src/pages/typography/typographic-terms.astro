    Now, before we go deeper into typography, let&apos;s first get familiar with
    some of the common jargons. Trust me, if you don&apos;t know these,
    you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;re reading a completely different language.
    Once you understand them, everything else we cover will make a lot more
    sense.
