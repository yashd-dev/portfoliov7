          Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written
          language legible, readable, and visually appealing. It&apos;s one of
          the most essential elements in design, whether you&apos;re working on
          websites, apps, or print. Like it or not, typography plays a huge role
          in the overall look and feel of your project. Sometimes it&apos;s the
          star of the show, grabbing all the attention. Other times, it quietly
          supports the design in the background. Let's explore it together and
          see how we can better utilize it!

          This series is all about better understanding the world of typography.
          As both a developer and a designer, I&apos;ve come across many
          concepts that felt completely unfamiliar and honestly, some of the
          terminology sounded like straight-up gibberish. So, this series is my
          attempt to help you, my viewers, discover something new about
          typography.

          In typography, broadly speaking, there are two main font families:
          <strong>serif</strong> and <strong>sans serif</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&apos;s start with <strong>serif</strong>. A serif is simply a
          small decorative line or stroke that&apos;s added to the ends of
          letters. Think of it as a little “foot” or “hat” that finishes off the
          letter&apos;s shape. Fonts with these little details are called serif
          fonts.
        </p>
        <img src="/typography/serif.png" />
        <p>
          The image will give you a good idea of the little “hats” and “feet”
          I&apos;m talking about. But how did we even end up with serifs in the
          first place?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, way back in the day, before Figma, before Photoshop, people were
          literally carving letters into stone. Roman stonecutters found that if
          they finished each stroke with a tiny extra cut, it stopped the stone
          from chipping and made the edges look cleaner. These little finishing
          strokes eventually became what we now call serifs. So, fun fact: they
          weren&apos;t even meant to be decorative at first they were just smart
          engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, people realized serifs actually help with reading too. They
          guide your eyes along the line of text, make letters sit neatly on the
          baseline, and even help distinguish characters from one another.
          Basically, they&apos;re like tiny anchors for your text.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when printing came along, serifs were still super useful. Old
          printing presses and rough paper loved them because they kept the ink
          from bleeding too much and made the letters sturdier on the page.
        </p>

          And, as creative as human minds are, we didn&apos;t just stop at <em
            >serif</em
          >. Over the years, designers and typographers spun off more
          sub-categories of serif styles, each with its own vibe and purpose.
