Now, before we go deeper into typography, let’s first get familiar with some of the common jargons.  
Trust me, if you don’t know these, you’ll feel like you’re reading a completely different language.  
Once you understand them, everything else we cover will make a lot more sense.  

## Key Typography Terms

### 1. Stress  
Refers to the **angle or direction** of the thickened strokes in a letterform, especially in letters with curves like "O" or "e". **Example**, In Old Style fonts, the thickest part of the “O” is slightly diagonal, while in modern fonts it’s perfectly vertical.  

### 2. Bracketed Serif  
The **curve or transition** where the serif meets the main stroke. Bracketed serifs have a smooth, rounded connection, unlike unbracketed ones that meet at a sharp angle.  

### 3. Stroke  
Any **line that makes up a letter**—whether straight, curved, thick, or thin. **Primary strokes** are the main structure of the letter; **secondary strokes** are decorative or connecting elements.  

### 4. Stem  
The **main vertical or diagonal line** in a letterform, like the vertical line in "T" or the diagonal in "V".  

### 5. Ascender  
The part of a lowercase letter that **extends above the x-height** (main body height), like the vertical line in "h", "l", or "b".  

### 6. Descender  
The part of a lowercase letter that **extends below the baseline**, like the tail in "p", "q", "y".  

### 7. Baseline  
The invisible line that most letters **sit on**, this keeps type aligned and consistent.  

### 8. X-Height  
The height of lowercase letters, measured from the baseline to the top of the lowercase “x”. Affects readability and the perceived size of text.  

### 9. Counter  
The **enclosed or partially enclosed space** inside a letter. The hole in “o”, “p”, or “e”.  

### 10. Ligature  
A **special combined character** made by joining two or more letters for visual or functional reasons. Like “fi” or “ﬂ” in some fonts.
