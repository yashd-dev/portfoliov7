I have been using Github Co-pilot for around 6 months and I have a love hate relationship with it. It's great because it helped me in filling out boilerplate code and simpler code snippets. It's bad as well due to it auto-filling the logical aspects of my code and it deciding the logic and me jus brushing over the snippet once and calling it a day. As a software developer, I have to keep in mind of many things apart from what the logic is like the surrounding things that affect the logic.
