## Preface

> I have a lot of my peers ask me how I do so well in tech. In reality, I'm just a regular person who has a passion for technology. I'm just a student like them.

Okay that was a very negative start but had to give that preface. And just so we are on same page, by _Tech_ I mean the actual technical aspects like the hot new JS framework that comes out every second, about debugging some arbitrary audio driver that is not working for hours and learning a lot in the process.

Im currently in my 1st year and its safe to say im little above average than most people in my college. I'm not saying this to brag but to give context. That is because my college has such low barrier to entry that you don't need to have amazing grades to get in, you need to have a lot of money to get in. So, most of the people in my college are just doing it for the sake of it.

I'll just say that most of my peers that ask me "How are you so good at xyz technology" aren't really that passionate about tech and not putting much efforts into it. If you don't code in your past time, making dumb or revolutionary projects, you are not passionate about tech. I personally learn by making projects and dumb mistakes during those projects, going into rabbit-holes. Instead of taking up the initiative to solve that problem, they just ask me or someone else to solve it for them. I'm not saying that you should not ask for help, but you should atleast try to solve it yourself before asking for help. I did not have anyone to ask for help yet I somehow managed to solve it.

## Story Time !

So this is when i was in 11th grade, and I was getting into Web Development and was learning HTML and CSS. I then got this opportunity to be in the technical department of my college's fest. The hierarchy was such that there Heads of Department and Executives (similar to interns) and we were asked to learn Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the website along with a Figma prototype within 3 weeks, an entirely overkill tech stack in hindsight. I had zero knowledge of Javascript at that time, yet I managed to make a page with animations and all. It wasn't the best but it was something, I pulled something of in this short timespan without asking my Heads for help. I was proud of myself.

This whole essay started because we had our end sem technical projects and most of my peers were asking me for help. I was happy to help them but I was also a bit sad that they didn't even try to solve it themselves, sometimes the answer was a simple google search. Had to get this off my chest.

> p.s. No hard feelings to anyone, just my thoughts on the matter. :)
